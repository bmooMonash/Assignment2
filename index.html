                <p>A shark attack is an attack on a human by a shark. Every year, around 80 unprovoked attacks are reported worldwide. 
                    Despite their rarity, many people fear shark attacks after occasional serial attacks, 
                    such as the Jersey Shore shark attacks of 1916, and horror fiction and films such as the Jaws series. 
                    Out of more than 489 shark species, only three of them are responsible for a double-digit number of fatal, 
                    unprovoked attacks on humans: the great white, tiger, and bull.</p>

                    <h3>Blacktip Shark</h3>
                    <p>The blacktip shark (Carcharhinus limbatus) is a species of requiem shark, and part of the family Carcharhinidae. 
                        It is common to coastal tropical and subtropical waters around the world, including brackish habitats.</p>
                    <p>The blacktip shark has a stout, fusiform body with a pointed snout, long gill slits, and no ridge between the dorsal fins. 
                        Most individuals have black tips or edges on the pectoral, dorsal, pelvic, and caudal fins. It usually attains a length of 1.5 m (4.9 ft).</p> 
                    <p>Normally wary of humans, blacktip sharks can become aggressive in the presence of food and have been responsible for a number of attacks on people</p>

                    <h3>Bronze Whaler Shark</h3>
                    <p>The copper shark (Carcharhinus brachyurus), bronze whaler, or narrowtooth shark, is a species of requiem shark, family Carcharhinidae, 
                        and the only member of its genus found mostly at temperate latitudes.</p>
                    <p>The copper shark is difficult to distinguish from other large requiem sharks. It is characterized by its narrow, hook-shaped upper teeth, 
                        lack of a prominent ridge between the dorsal fins, and plain bronze coloration.</p> 
                    <p>Copper sharks only attack humans infrequently, but the species places tenth in the number of unprovoked attacks on people</p>

                <div id="Bull Shark" class="tabsharks">
                    <h3>Bull Shark</h3>
                    <p>The bull shark (Carcharhinus leucas), also known as the "Zambezi shark" (informally "zambi") in Africa, and "Lake Nicaragua shark" in Nicaragua, 
                        is a requiem shark commonly found worldwide in warm, shallow waters along coasts and in rivers.</p>
                    <p>It is known for its aggressive nature, and presence in warm, shallow brackish and freshwater systems including estuaries and rivers.</p> 
                    <p>Larger-sized bull sharks are probably responsible for the majority of near-shore shark attacks, including many bites attributed to other species.</p>

                <div id="Goblin Shark" class="tabsharks">
                    <h3>Goblin Shark</h3>
                    <p>The goblin shark (Mitsukurina owstoni) is a rare species of deep-sea shark. Sometimes called a "living fossil", it is the only extant 
                        representative of the family Mitsukurinidae, a lineage some 125 million years old.</p>
                    <p>Goblin sharks are benthopelagic creatures that inhabit upper continental slopes, submarine canyons, and seamounts throughout the world at depths greater than 100 m (330 ft)</p> 
                    <p>This pink-skinned animal has a distinctive profile with an elongated, flat snout, and highly protrusible jaws containing prominent nail-like teeth. It is usually between 3 and 4 m (10 and 13 ft) long when mature.</p>

                <div id="Great White Shark" class="tabsharks">
                    <h3>Great White Shark</h3>
                    <p>The great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias), also known as the white shark, white pointer, or simply great white, is a species of large mackerel 
                        shark which can be found in the coastal surface waters of all the major oceans.</p>
                    <p>The great white shark has no known natural predators other than, on very rare occasions, the killer whale.[11] It is arguably the world's largest-known extant macropredatory fish, 
                        and is one of the primary predators of marine mammals, up to the size of large baleen whales. </p> 
                    <p>This shark is also known to prey upon a variety of other marine animals, including fish, and seabirds. It is the only known surviving species of its genus Carcharodon, 
                        and is responsible for more recorded human bite incidents than any other shark</p>

                <div id="Hammerhead Shark" class="tabsharks">
                    <h3>Hammerhead Shark</h3>
                    <p>The hammerhead sharks are a group of sharks that form the family Sphyrnidae, so named for the unusual and distinctive structure of their heads, 
                        which are flattened and laterally extended into a "hammer" shape called a cephalofoil.</p>
                    <p>Many, but not necessarily mutually exclusive, functions have been postulated for the cephalofoil, including sensory reception, manoeuvering, and prey manipulation.
                            The cephalofoil gives the shark superior binocular vision and depth perception</p>
                    <p>Hammerheads are found worldwide in warmer waters along coastlines and continental shelves. Unlike most sharks, 
                        some hammerhead species usually swim in schools during the day, becoming solitary hunters at night.</p>

                <div id="Tiger Shark" class="tabsharks">
                    <h3>Tiger Shark</h3>
                    <p>The tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier[3]) is a species of requiem shark and the only extant member of the genus Galeocerdo.
                        It is a large macropredator, capable of attaining a length over 5 m (16 ft 5 in)</p>
                    <p>Populations are found in many tropical and temperate waters, especially around central Pacific islands.
                         Its name derives from the dark stripes down its body, which resemble a tiger's pattern, but fade as the shark matures.</p>
                    <p>The tiger shark is second only to the great white in recorded fatal attacks on humans, but these events are still exceedingly rare</p>
